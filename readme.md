hi this shoban 
first lab
again adding some content to the file 
so we shall see what happend

Now i am doing changes in new branch
The purpose of branch is:when we get defect from others or the team want to create or devlope the new function on the same project we should create the branch and checkout to new branch and modifie the repository..
 we should not work from master when we get changes or devloping new function
